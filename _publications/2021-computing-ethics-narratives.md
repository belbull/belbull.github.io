title: "Computing ethics narratives: Teaching computing ethics and the impact of predictive algorithms"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2021-computing-ethics-narratives
excerpt: "In this paper, we present a novel repository of computing ethics teaching modules that aim to help faculty create *ethical laboratories* that can support CS students' ethical reasoning skills. To show the potential of these narratives, we share preliminary findings from a pilot of a predictive policing module implemented in an intermediate algorthims course. Feedback suggests the predictive policing module was able to help students contextualize the ethical issues around the topic. However, students recommended devoting more class time to evaluating the technical complexities of these critical systems."
