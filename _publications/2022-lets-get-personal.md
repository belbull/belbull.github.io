permalink: /publication/2022-lets-get-personal
excerpt: "**How are personalized, news visualizations designed and how might our design choices impact readers' exploration?** Personalized visualizations refer to **visualizations that can be segmented using a reader's demographic information**. For example, a reader may be able to enter their zip code and age to see how climate change has impacted their hometown. In this paper, we develop a design space of over 40 news articles with personalized visalizations and find that such articles often lack explicit guideline for exploring data, information on how reader demographic information is stored, and personalized insights from the visualization."
