excerpt: "**How do Ph.D. students from under-represented groups learn and fulfill departmental and advisor expectations?** As institutions navigate Ph.D. attrition, students from under-represented groups (URGs) in computer science face additional representational challenges. Previous research shows that clear expectations can be a key factor to improving such attrition. We interview 14 Ph.D. students from URGs to understand how they learn about and fulfill these expectations. Our participants report that prior experiences alone often did not fully prepare them graduate school. Furthermore, our participants worked across multiple sources to gain both high and low-level guidance from their academic communities. We generate recommendations for both advisors and departments to better support Ph.D. students."
